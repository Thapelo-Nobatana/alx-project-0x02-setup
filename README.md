# Next.js Project Setup and Basics.


This repository serves as a foundational starting point for building modern web applications using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It is part of the ALX Frontend Pro curriculum and focuses on establishing best practices in project structure, component design, API integration, and responsive styling.

The purpose of this repository is to help learn how to:

- Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Organize the codebase using a clean, scalable folder structure.
- Build and reuse UI components using TypeScript interfaces.
- Implement basic routing, interactivity, and data fetching from APIs.
- Follow modern development workflows using ESLint, Git, and modular CSS.

This project lays the groundwork for more advanced frontend features and helps reinforce key concepts needed for real-world React/Next.js development.
